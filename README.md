## Wireframes

Wireframes proved quite useful. Some features where implemented like main mage structure, intention of header, footer, etc.. Navbars where not implemented as imagined + few other smaller omits. Which is very understandable since its my first project. Im even surprised that i did not changed it even more! It was very challenging to tackle with so many data and learning in short time + demanding private responsibilities. Long days and sleepless nights, and i am very proud. exhausted and very happy actually! :D I enjoyed every single second of coding, all mistakes and sucesses, i just love it! It captivated me :) [Wireframes](assets/images/wireframes-md.jpg)
