            How it all started?
        </h2>

        <p>
            Caffeine has been consumed by humans all over the world for thousands of years.
            The main sources of caffeine are coffee and tea, but it is also found in cocoa beans, guarana, yerba mate, and around 60 other plant species.
            Many of the plants containing caffeine are found in the temperate zones of different continents around the world.

            An ancient Chinese legend says the Emperor Shen Nung first discovered tea in 2437 BCE when the wind blew leaves into his boiling water.
            He was intrigued by the pleasant aroma and invigorated after drinking it. An excavated mausoleum from Xi’an,
            China for Emperor Jing from the Han Dynasty lends physical evidence to the fact that it was being consumed at least as early as 141 BCE

            Coffee, on the other hand, has its own legends from native tribes of the Ethiopian Peninsula.
            The goat herder Kaldi, who may have lived in the 9th century CE, discovered his goats would not sleep after consuming the berries of a certain plant.
            He concocted a drink from the berries and stayed alert through long hours of prayer.
            These coffee berries were eventually transported to Arabia in the 15th century where they are still cultivated today.

            Americas have their versions of a caffeinated drinks too. Most popular is made from cacao (pronounced ke’kaou).
            The first civilization to utilize it were the Olmecs of Mexico.
            The drink was passed on to the Izapa, the Mayans, and finally to Europeans who used the cacao beans to make confections.

            Yerba mate, called “Drink of the Gods” is a traditional South American caffeine-rich infused drink.
            It can be traced back to 3000 BCE. Used by semi-nomadic Guarani people of southern Brazil, northern Argentina and Paraguay,
            it is recognised by characteristic pot and straw used for drinking Mate tea.

            The tribes of Amazona use the properties of guarana since time immemorial, preparing ointments and medicines.
            The guaraná drink prepared by the tribes is renowned for its healing and energy-boosting properties.
            In the local language "guaraná" translates as "the beginning of all knowledge."

            The origins of matcha can be traced all the way back to the Tang Dynasty in China. The Tang Dynasty spanned the 7th – 10th centuries.
            During this time, the Tang Dynasty steamed tea leaves to form into bricks, making their tea harvests easier to transport and subsequently trade.
            These tea bricks were prepared by roasting and pulverizing the leaves then mixing the resulting tea powder with water and salt.
