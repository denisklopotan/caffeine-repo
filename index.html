            How it all started?
        </h2>
        <p>
            Caffeine has been consumed by humans all over the world for thousands of years.
            An ancient Chinese legend says the Emperor Shen Nung first discovered tea in 2437 BCE when the wind blew leaves into his boiling water.
            He was intrigued by the pleasant aroma and invigorated after drinking it.

            Coffee, on the other hand, has its own legends from native tribes of the Ethiopian Peninsula.
            The goat herder Kaldi, who may have lived in the 9th century CE, discovered his goats would not sleep after consuming the berries of a certain plant.
            He concocted a drink from the berries and stayed alert through long hours of prayer.
            These coffee berries were eventually transported to Arabia in the 15th century where they are still cultivated today.

            Even the Americas had their version of a caffeinated drink made from cacao (pronounced ke’kaou).
            The first civilization to utilize it were the Olmecs of Mexico.
            The drink was passed on to the Izapa, the Mayans, and finally to Europeans who used the cacao beans to make confections.

            Yerba mate, called “Drink of the Gods” can be traced back to 3000 BCE. Used by semi-nomadic Guarani people of southern Brazil, northern Argentina and Paraguay,
            it can be recognised by characteristic pot and straw used for drinking Mate tea.
